Website Image Slider refers to the features on the website header or hero section where the user can slide images by clicking on the nav button or as well as by grabbing the image. Also, there is pagination that shows how many images that website has on the harder section. We can see such type of features in many types of websites like e-commerce, sports, newspaper, travel/tour, and many many others.
